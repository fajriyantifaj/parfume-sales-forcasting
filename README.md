# Perfume Sales Prediction: Naive, Holt's Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA Methods

The Perfume Sales Prediction project focuses on accurately forecasting sales in the perfume industry. In this project, we explore three commonly used forecasting methods: the Naive method, Holt's exponential smoothing method, and the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) method.

The goal of this project is to utilize historical sales data to predict future perfume sales. By analyzing past sales patterns and trends, these forecasting methods can provide valuable insights for businesses, allowing them to make informed decisions about inventory management, production planning, and sales strategies.

The Naive method assumes that future sales will be equal to the most recent observed sales value. Holt's exponential smoothing method takes into account both the level and trend of the sales data, providing a more nuanced prediction. The ARIMA method incorporates the autocorrelation and seasonality of the sales data, offering a robust forecasting model.

To evaluate the performance of these forecasting methods, we use two widely adopted evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). MAPE measures the accuracy of the forecasts in terms of percentage errors, while RMSE calculates the average magnitude of the forecast errors.

By comparing the results obtained from the three methods and assessing their performance using MAPE and RMSE, we can determine which method yields the most accurate perfume sales predictions. This project aims to empower businesses in the perfume industry to make data-driven decisions, optimize their sales forecasting, and drive growth in their market.

The Perfume Sales Prediction project offers valuable insights into forecasting methods and their application in the perfume industry. By harnessing the power of data analysis and time series forecasting, businesses can enhance their sales strategies, adapt to market dynamics, and achieve sustainable success in the competitive perfume market.
